# Speed Dating Classification Model

## Overview

This project involves building a classification model to predict the outcome of speed dating events. The model aims to classify whether two participants will have a successful match based on various features collected during the event.

This is my first project that I've published to Github so my primary aim was to gain familiarity with a project workflow and to gain familiarity with techniques such as oversampling, cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information collected from speed dating events, including:

- Participant demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Preferences and interests
- Responses to various questions
- Outcome of the speed dating event (match or no match)

## Model Training

The model is trained using a Gradient Boosting classifier. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation are performed to optimize the model's performance.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

## Results

The final model achieves an accuracy of 79% on the test set. Confusion matrix shown below:
